    "Lifelike computer-animated characters and animals are increasingly pervasive in today’s society:  they are now commonly encountered in games, advertisements, feature animation, and a variety of other fields. It’s interesting to realize that all of these animated characters initially start out as static 3D shapes, not unlike stone sculptures that are unable to move. Before a character built in this way can be seen in motion, the precise way in which its shape can change over time must be characterized mathematically. The most common way of doing this entails designing a customized 3D skeleton that is then attached to its outer skin. Subsequently, any adjustment to the posture of the skeleton will result in a corresponding change to the posture of the character. The figure below shows a simple character with an embedded skeleton and two example poses that were created by  rotating the joints of the skeleton.\n",

    "A skeleton can range from a few elements to massively complex arrangements that reproduce the entire biological structure of the person or animal in question.

    "As you can see in the above figure, each bone is essentially a line segment with a joint where it is connected to the previous bone. The bone can rotate in any way, but the connection between two bones can never move apart. Each bone also has a fixed length, in other words: it is rigid and never compresses or expands. On the other side, the next bone is generally attached. In 3D, a variety of rotations are possible (e.g. around the X, Y, or Z axis). In two dimensions things are simpler, and a single angle is enough to completely characterize the rotation of a bone relative to its predecessor bone. Everything in this homework will be in two dimensions to keep things simple.\n",

The first bone doesn't have a predecessor, hence $\\theta_1$ is measured relative to the $X$ axis. Note how the complete set of bone angles $\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots$ is all the information we need to compute the precise positions of all the joint positions in Euclidean space.\n",
